## Stakeholders

### Interviewee:
-**Name**: Dan Dai
- **Occupation**: Student
### Goals/Needs:
1. **Efficient Task Management**: Needs to assign tasks to team members quickly and track progress on a centralized platform.
2. **Clear Deadlines**: Emphasizes the importance of setting and visualizing deadlines with reminders to avoid delays.
3. **Better Communication**: Wants to streamline communication for each task to avoid jumping between different messaging platforms.
4. **Time Tracking**: A feature to log hours spent on tasks to ensure accountability and keep the team on track.
### Problems/Frustrations:
1. **Scattered Information**: Struggles with keeping all relevant documents and communication in one place. Often, vital information gets lost in emails or chats.
2. **Deadline Confusion**: Sometimes team members miss deadlines due to unclear or poorly communicated timelines, especially when changes occur.
3. **Lack of Accountability**: There is no clear tracking of which team member is behind on their tasks, making it difficult to address issues early.
4. **Notification Overload**: Too many notifications from different platforms (email, Slack, etc.) make it difficult to prioritize important updates.


## Product Vision Statement

This Project Tracker App is designed to enhance collaboration and efficiency by providing tools for task allocation, real-time progress tracking, personalized to-do lists and team meeting arrangement. Whether you're managing a project, organizing an event, or working on group assignments, this app helps streamline workflows and keep everyone on the same page.

## User Requirements

1. **As a student working on a group project**, I want the app to automatically suggest work allocation based on each team member's strengths and availability so that we can distribute tasks more fairly and clearly define each person's mission.

2. **As a project manager**, I want a task divider that breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks and assigns them to my team based on skill sets and workload so that everyone has clear responsibilities.

3. **As a team member**, I want a personalized to-do list that automatically updates when tasks are assigned to me, so I can easily see what is expected of me and prioritize my work.

4. **As a project manager**, I want a progress tracker that visually shows the completion percentage of each task and the overall project so that I can identify delays and make adjustments if necessary.

5. **As an event organizer**, I want a team planner that allows me to group people into specific teams and assign each team a set of tasks based on their expertise, so I can manage work distribution more efficiently.

6. **As an event organizer**, I want a dynamic task distribution system that highlights which tasks are completed and which are pending in real-time, so I can quickly see what still needs attention and adjust the workflow if necessary.

7. **As a project manager**, I want to generate reports on completed tasks and team performance so that I can evaluate productivity and identify bottlenecks.

8. **As a computer science student**, I want to assign tasks to specific individuals so that responsibilities are clearly defined, and progress is more trackable.

9. **As a professor**, I want to track each student group's progress on their project in real-time so that I can provide timely feedback, ensure they are meeting milestones throughout the course, and offer help accordingly.

10. **As a lead traveler**, I want to assign trip planning and booking tasks to different members of the group so that everyone contributes and we stay organized throughout the planning process.
